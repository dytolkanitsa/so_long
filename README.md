# so_long
School 21 project

This project is a very small 2D game. It is built to make you work with
textures, sprites. And some very basic gameplay elements.

This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc.
As a graphic design project, so long will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, textures, etc.
